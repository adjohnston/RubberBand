## A Responsive Web Design Tool

So, what is __RubberBand__? It's a light-weight, versatile and simple to use. Below I will outline a few features and then offer up a how to guide, where you can learn how to get started, how to use the tool and some of the options you can define to customize your experience.

### Responsive Columns &amp; Baslines

Depending on your browser or device, you'll be shown a group of columns consisting of four (mobile), eight (tablet) or sixteen (desktop, large screen). As the browser resizes so too will the columns, baselines and the amount of them. RubberBand allows you to easily lay out your content across any device.

### CSS Calculator

RubberBand relies heavily on percentages and calculating ems instead of relying on the good 'ol pixels of the past. Because of that you will most likely be doing lots of calculations, new font-sizes, line-heights, margins and padding. I decided to simplify the process and offer a calculator, all you do now is type your desired font-size and have the CSS generated for you, speedy!

### Viewport Switching

There will come a time when you want to see how your page will look in smaller windows and on different devices, resizing a browser manually is annoying and you may just want to see your design quickly at a certain width without having to upload and view through a device. RubberBand can take care of that, meaning making changes is that little bit faster.
